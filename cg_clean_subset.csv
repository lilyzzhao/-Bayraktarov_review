All outplanted colonies were measured immediately after transplantation to reef, and then 5 and 12 months later.",Coral gardening - Transplantation phase,Yes,Not reported,Not reported,"During 1 year of rearing, M. digitata ramets in the nursery exhibited a high survivorship (87%), and fast growth rates (217–927%), despite minimal maintenance and having to overcome the adverse effect of a strong typhoon. Following transplantation, 17% of the corals remained alive on the knolls with 37% loss due to mortality and 46% loss due to detachment. The weakness in the transplantation phase was M. digitata’s slow attachment to the substrate, which may be improved by having the coral tissue touching the substrate by drilling deeper holes in it.",No,No,Partially,No,No,No,No,No,Growth rate,Species composition,"Growth, productivity of species",Survival (of more than one species),Species composition,Survivorship of species,Growth (ecological volume),Ecosystem function,"Growth, productivity",Mortality,Ecosystem function,Survivorship,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Species composition,Ecosystem function
