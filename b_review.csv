Proc Proceedings of the Coastal Engineering Conference,conference proceedings,1996,1994-1995,,primary,"Two coral reef sites in the Florida Keys were structurally restored after having sustained severe damage from the groundings of large vessels (two separate incidents in 1989: by the 40-m M/V Alec Owen Maitland and the 142-m M/V Elpis). The project was completed in 1995 and consisted of major structural restoration of a damaged reef (vs. in-kind mitigation using artificial reefs). Restoration focused on the stabilization of coral rubble and large craters which resulted from the vessel groundings. A stable foundation which closely emulates the adjacent natural seabed and which would foster future recruitment of local biota ws re-created. At the Maitland site, a 370-m2 crater was refilled, while the damaged area at the Elpis site had two craters: one measuring 69 m2 and one of 163 m2. Environmental monitoring consited of measuring the turbidity for an unspecified amount of time.",physical,stabilizing of substrate after ship grounding,Substrate stabilisation,,,"Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, Florida Keys",25.177062,-80.247027,United States,USA,High income,"Work at one site included the mechanical transfer of coral rubble back into the craters, placement of limerock boulders atop the rubble, and back-filling the boulders' voids with carbonate sand. Work at the other site included excavation of coral rubble and the precision placement of 40 pre-cast reefreplicating armor units into the crater. The project's construction cost (bid) was U.S. $1,047,000, with subsequent change orders resulting in a net additional cost of $ 19,600.",yes,,,yes,yes,,yes,,,yes,"The engineering assessment, design, and construction review work described herein were conducted in principal part by Olsen Associates, Inc. under subcontract to Industrial Economics Inc.

The leadership of Dr. Dan Sheehy, of IEc, in this project is specifically noted. Initial site survey work was coordinated by Mr. Keith Spring of Continental Shelf Associates, Inc. (CSA), of Jupiter, Florida. The Engineer's on-site technical representative was Mr. Mark Schroeder, also of CSA. Hydrographic survey work was conducted by ARC Surveying & Mapping, Inc., of Jacksonville, FL. Mr. Chris Creed, of Olsen Associates, Inc., greatly assisted in the site survey, data analysis and preparation of the engineering assessment. The innovative internal structural design and specifications for the Maitland site armor units was principally created by Mr. Steve Klecka of SK Engineering, Inc., Jacksonville, FL. The highly succesful concrete mix design and specifications were provided by Dr. Dale Berner of Ben C. Gerwick, Inc. (BCG), of San Francisco, California; and then field-reviewed by Mr. Patrick Durnal of BCG. Construction management was executed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District. Construction review for environmental protection was directed by Messrs. Harold Hudson, Bill Goodwin, and John Halas of the NOAA Sanctuaries and Reserves Division, Key Largo. The construction contractor was Team Land Development, Inc., Pompano Beach, Florida; Mr. Ron Coddington, President. For the contractor, Mr. Charles Calloway was the lead engineer.

Cost include: different wage rates were set depending on the skill-level required for each task as follows: level 1 (highest salary, e.g. scientific adviser/expert), US$5.63 h-1; level 2 (medium salary, e.g. trained local staff), US$3.50 h-1; and level 3 (lowest, e.g. trained manual labour), US$1.31 h-1. Costs for capital equipment, i.e. equipment such as microscopes that could be used for longer than the duration of this project, were given a 3-year life span; therefore, the total capital equipment costs were divided by three. Cost of dive equipment was based on local rental costs of $20 person-1 day-1 as the total cost of renting for this project was less than the cost of purchasing four full sets of diving equipment.  Cost per coral was estimated by dividing the total cost for the project by the number of plug-ins containing one surviving coral for different production stages as follows: (1) a coral at the in situ nursery ready to be transplanted at 7, 14 and 19 months, (2) the cost of an outplanted juvenile for each age/size class and (3) the cost for a surviving 2.5-year-old transplanted coral. Calculations for total cost per area are based on a transplanting schedule with coral colonies transplanted at a distance of 0.5 m from each other resulting in a coral density of 4 colonies/m2 or 40,000 coral transplants per 1 ha (Edwards & Gomez 2007).
